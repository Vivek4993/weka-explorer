Data Analysis Projects Using WEKA
Welcome to my GitHub page showcasing data analysis projects conducted using WEKA, a powerful tool for data mining tasks, including classification, regression, and clustering. WEKA's user-friendly graphical interface makes it an excellent choice for various machine learning algorithms.
Projects Overview
1. HR Data Analysis
•	Files: HR Data.csv, HR Data.xlsx
•	Description: Analyzed HR data to identify trends and insights. Applied machine learning algorithms to understand employee performance, retention patterns, and more.
2. Medical Diagnostic Data Analysis
•	File: PCOS_data.arff
•	Description: Conducted comprehensive analysis of medical diagnostic data related to PCOS using WEKA. Implemented k-means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and other algorithms to evaluate variance, correlation, and key performance indicators (KPIs). Presented findings to enhance understanding of medical diagnostics.
Key Techniques Used
•	K-Means Clustering: Grouped data into clusters to identify patterns and insights.
•	Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduced dimensionality and highlighted key features impacting the data.
•	Other Machine Learning Algorithms: Applied various techniques to analyze and interpret data comprehensively.
